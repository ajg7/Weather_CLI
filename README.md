# Weather_CLI

Simple CLI that fetches the current weather of selected city or town

## Use

<code>cargo run <city_name></code>

Example:

<code>cargo run Lincoln</code>

It will provide you with the name of the city, the current temperature in Farenheit, what it feels like in Farenheit, & the wind speed in mph.

## Background

I wanted to make a project using Rust, and I chose this because their was a nice and short tutorial on making API calls in Rust. I added some extra content such as wind speed and conversion between kelvin and farenheit.
