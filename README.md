# Weather_CLI

Simple CLI that fetches the current weather of selected city or town

## Rationale

This is my first project using Rust. I followed a youtube tutorial to make this, because I wanted to start making a project in Rust to help learn it.

### Use

<code>cargo run <city_name></code>

Example:

<code>cargo run Lincoln</code>

It will provide you with the name of the city, the current temperature in Farenheit, what it feels like in Farenheit, & the wind speed in mph.
